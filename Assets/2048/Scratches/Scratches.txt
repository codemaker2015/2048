1. Convert the game into AMVCC
2. Input manager will be converted into input view and input controller
3. GameManager will be Game controller.
4. Tile Style holder should be a scriptable object in model class, so that I can simply change the scriptable object any time
	without worrying what happens to the game.
5. Tile is just a view. So, it must notify the controller what to do.
6. Change the string Find NumberedCell in Tile to something that is not a string dependent.
7. Tile _tileImage is getting NumberedCell by searching through a name. This should not be happening.
8. In GameManager, the allTiles array is currently getting static variables. This should not be the case.
9. I manually put the index of tiles for row and column. Need to find a way to automate it.
10. Replace all animations to using tweens for both appearence and merges.
11. Change playerprefs to actual file storage.
